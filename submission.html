    <h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Scope 🎯</h2>
    <p>We welcome submissions covering the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Foundations & Model Architectures:</strong> Core theoretical underpinnings and structural designs for generative AI, including machine learning paradigms, deep learning architectures, statistical learning theory, and probabilistic modeling approaches.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimization & System Efficiency:</strong> Algorithmic optimization strategies and system-level solutions to enhance generative AI training and deployment, covering convex/non-convex optimization, distributed computing, hardware adaptation, and generative reinforcement learning.</li>
      <li><strong>Trustworthiness & Evaluation:</strong> Frameworks for ensuring reliability, safety, and validity of generative AI systems, including fairness, robustness, privacy, interpretability, and rigorous evaluation methodologies.</li>
      <li><strong>Application-Driven Innovation:</strong> Innovative generative AI techniques, datasets, and problem-solving approaches tailored to real-world domains such as healthcare, biosciences, sustainability, and climate science.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Manuscript Requirements 📝</h2>
